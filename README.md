First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/Forms-demo.git

Change into the directory:

    cd Forms-demo

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 00_blank_slate origin/00_blank_slate
    git checkout -b 01_user_interface origin/01_user_interface
    git checkout -b 02_create_new_form origin/02_create_new_form
    git checkout -b 03_implement_save_action origin/03_implement_save_action
    git checkout -b 04_create_edit_form origin/04_create_edit_form
